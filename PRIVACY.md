# Privacy Policy for Salesforce Toolkit for Dev


## Overview

**Salesforce Toolkit for Dev** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the developer experience on [developer.salesforce.com](https://developer.salesforce.com). It operates entirely within the browser and does not transmit or share any personal data.

## What Data We Collect

As of this version, **this extension does not collect or transmit any user data**.

- ❌ No personal information (name, email, ID)

- ❌ No passwords, cookies, or authentication tokens

## Permissions & Access

The extension requests access only to:

- `https://developer.salesforce.com/*`

This allows it to read the content of Salesforce Developer Docs to insert helpful UI elements like field summaries, tooltips, and export buttons.

It **does not** modify any other sites or access other browser data.

---

## Local Storage

Currently, **this extension does not store any data in localStorage**.

In future versions, we may use localStorage to:

- Remember your preferred field quote format (`'field'`, `"field"`, or plain)
- Save search filters or last-used section
- Store UI preferences (collapsed sections, theme, etc.)

This data will remain entirely in your browser and **will never be synced or transmitted**.

---

## Data Transmission

This extension does **not make any remote requests**, does not load external JavaScript, and does not send any information outside of your browser.

All enhancements are done using local content scripting and DOM manipulation.
